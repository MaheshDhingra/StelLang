# Introduction

**Welcome to the world of Crabby!** A programming language made entirely in **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn)**, designed to meet the demands of the modern programming era. Crabby is not just another language; it's a paradigm shift that aims to redefine the way we approach programming.

Crabby has a **Pythonic** yet **Functional**-like syntax. Which means if you know mostly about coding in Python,
you'd probably appreciate this language.

Crabby file formats are either `.crab` or `.cb`, but `.crab` is widely recommended for now.

## Features

- Crabby designed for simplicity.
- Easy to learn and understand.
- Ideal for beginners.
- Powerful for handling complex tasks.
- Suitable for experienced developers too.

## Example

This is an example of a **hello world** program

```js
print("hello world!")
```

### math.crab

```js
let x = 10
let y = 10

print(x + y)
```

### if-else.crab

```js
let x = true
let y = false

if x: {
    print("True!")
} else {
    print("False!")
}
```

### lambda.crab

```js
let x = lambda(a): {
    return a + 10
}

print(x(5))
```

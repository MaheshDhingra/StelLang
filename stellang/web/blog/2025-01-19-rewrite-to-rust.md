# Crabby's Rewrite to Rust

Crabby's rewrite to Rust is a significant milestone in the Crabby's development. This rewrite aims to improve the language's performance, readability, and maintainability. Rewrite has been planned by Kazooki.

## Rewrite Process

The rewrite process involved several stages, including:

1. Identifying the core language features and designing the new syntax.
2. Implementing the new syntax in Rust.
3. Refactoring the codebase to improve performance and maintainability.

## Features from rewrite

* Crabby is Memory safe
* Crabby's Type checking
* Better error handling
* Ownership methods and features
* And many more to come

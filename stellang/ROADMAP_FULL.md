# StelLang Foundation Completion Roadmap

## 1. Operator Foundation
- [ ] Expand all arithmetic, bitwise, logical, and comparison operators for Int, Float, and Str in the interpreter.
- [ ] Add string repetition and concatenation.
- [ ] Add power, floor division, modulo, and bitwise ops for Int/Float.
- [ ] Add identity and membership operators (is, is not, in, not in).
- [ ] Add error/exception handling for unsupported operations.

## 2. Built-in Types & Methods
- [ ] Ensure all built-in types (bytes, bytearray, set, frozenset, dict, tuple, list, range, memoryview, etc.) are fully implemented.
- [ ] Implement all standard methods for these types (including edge cases and Python compatibility).
- [ ] Add/expand tests for all built-in types and methods.
- [ ] Implement and test slicing, iteration, and comprehensions for all sequence types.

## 3. Exception System
- [ ] Ensure all exceptions are raised and propagated with correct types and messages.
- [ ] Test exception hierarchy and custom exception creation.
- [ ] Add support for user-defined exceptions and exception chaining.

## 4. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Run the full built-in test suite after each major change.
- [ ] Fix all errors and failing tests before moving to the next step.
- [ ] Add new tests for any new features or edge cases.
- [ ] Add property-based and fuzz testing for interpreter robustness.

## 5. Package Manager & CLI Polish
- [ ] Ensure `stel` CLI is fully migrated and all commands work (init, add, build, install, test, update, etc.).
- [ ] Add version check and update instructions to `stel update`.
- [ ] Update documentation and help output for all CLI commands.
- [ ] Add support for dependency resolution, lockfiles, and publishing packages.
- [ ] Add project templates and scaffolding (e.g., `stel new --template`).

## 6. Language Features & Syntax
- [ ] Implement function definitions, closures, and first-class functions.
- [ ] Add support for classes, inheritance, and metaclasses.
- [ ] Implement modules, imports, and package system.
- [ ] Add decorators, context managers, and with-statements.
- [ ] Add async/await and coroutine support.
- [ ] Add pattern matching and structural pattern matching (PEP 634+).
- [ ] Add type annotations and gradual typing support.

## 7. Performance & Optimization
- [ ] Profile interpreter and optimize hot paths.
- [ ] Add bytecode compiler and VM (optional, for speed).
- [ ] Add JIT/AOT compilation hooks (future-proofing).
- [ ] Optimize memory usage and garbage collection.

## 8. Tooling & Ecosystem
- [ ] Add LSP server for editor integration (syntax highlighting, completion, etc.).
- [ ] Add formatter, linter, and static analysis tools.
- [ ] Add debugger and REPL improvements.
- [ ] Add documentation generator and test runner.

## 9. Final Review & Documentation
- [ ] Review all code for consistency, idiomatic Rust, and maintainability.
- [ ] Update README and in-code documentation for all new features and changes.
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass and the language is stable for release.
- [ ] Prepare launch blog post and migration guide for users.

**Instructions:**
- When you say "START", I will begin working through this roadmap step by step, building features, testing, and fixing errors until the foundation is complete.
- You do not need to intervene unless you want to change the roadmap or priorities.
- Estimated time to complete: 150 hours (with continuous iteration, testing, and polish).

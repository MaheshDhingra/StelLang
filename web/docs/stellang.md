# StelLang: The Modern Programming Language

**Author: Mahesh**

Welcome to the official documentation for **StelLang**! This page provides a comprehensive overview of the language, its philosophy, ecosystem, and tooling.

## What is StelLang?

StelLang is a modern programming language written in Rust, designed for simplicity, power, and a Pythonic yet functional syntax. It aims to make programming accessible for beginners while providing advanced features for experienced developers.

- **Simple & Readable**: Easy to learn, with clean syntax.
- **Powerful**: Supports advanced features like async/await, pattern matching, gradual typing, and more.
- **Safe & Fast**: Built on Rust for performance and safety.
- **Versatile**: Suitable for web, data, AI, and more.

## The Stel Ecosystem

- **Language Core**: The StelLang interpreter and standard library.
- **Package Manager (stel.rs)**: Manage, build, and publish StelLang projects and libraries.
- **Registry**: [Stel Registry](https://stellang.maheshdhingra.xyz/registry) for discovering and sharing packages.
- **Community**: [Discord](https://discord.gg/W4vJzEJb2C), [GitHub](https://github.com/MaheshDhingra/StelLang), and more.

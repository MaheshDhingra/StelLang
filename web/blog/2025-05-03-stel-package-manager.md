# stel.rs: The Package Manager Powering StelLang

**By Mahesh**

A great language needs a great ecosystem. That's why I built `stel.rs`, the official package manager for StelLang. In this post, I'll introduce its features and how it empowers developers.

## What is stel.rs?

- A CLI tool for managing StelLang projects and dependencies
- Inspired by Cargo, but tailored for StelLang
- Fast, efficient, and easy to use

## Key Features

- **Project Initialization**: `stel init`
- **Building & Running**: `stel build`, `stel run`
- **Testing**: `stel test`
- **Documentation**: `stel doc`
- **Publishing & Installing**: `stel publish`, `stel install`, `stel add`
- **Registry Integration**: Connects to the official Stel Registry

## Why It Matters

# Stel's Rewrite to Rust

Stel's rewrite to Rust is a significant milestone in the Stel's development. This rewrite aims to improve the language's performance, readability, and maintainability. Rewrite has been planned by Mahesh.

## Rewrite Process

The rewrite process involved several stages, including:

1. Identifying the core language features and designing the new syntax.
2. Implementing the new syntax in Rust.
3. Refactoring the codebase to improve performance and maintainability.

## Features from rewrite

* Stel is Memory safe
* Stel's Type checking
* Better error handling
* Ownership methods and features
* And many more to come

# Advanced Features in StelLang: Async, Pattern Matching, and More

**By Mahesh**

StelLang is not just simpleâ€”it's powerful. In this post, I'll introduce some of the advanced features that make StelLang stand out.

## Async/Await

StelLang supports asynchronous programming, allowing you to write non-blocking code with ease.

```stel
async def fetch_data() {
    // ...
}

await fetch_data()
```

## Pattern Matching

Pattern matching makes it easy to handle complex data structures and control flow.

```stel
let value = 42
match value {
    0 => print("Zero"),
    1..10 => print("Between 1 and 10"),
    _ => print("Something else")
}
```

## Gradual Typing

StelLang lets you choose between dynamic and static typing, giving you flexibility and safety.

```stel
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int {
    return a + b
}
```

## More Features

- Lambda functions
- Decorators
- Built-in exception system

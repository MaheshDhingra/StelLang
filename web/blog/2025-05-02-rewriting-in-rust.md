# Rewriting StelLang in Rust: A Technical Journey

**By Mahesh**

The decision to rewrite StelLang in Rust was driven by a commitment to performance, safety, and maintainability. This post shares the story, challenges, and lessons learned from this ambitious rewrite.

## Why Rust?

- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership model prevents many common bugs.
- **Performance**: Rust delivers C-like speed with modern ergonomics.
- **Ecosystem**: Leverage powerful crates and tooling.

## The Rewrite Process

1. **Planning**: Identified core features and designed new syntax.
2. **Implementation**: Rebuilt the interpreter, parser, and standard library in Rust.
3. **Refactoring**: Improved code structure, error handling, and extensibility.

## Challenges Faced

- Adapting to Rust's strictness
- Migrating existing features
- Ensuring compatibility and performance

## The Results

- Faster execution
- Fewer bugs
- Easier to maintain and extend

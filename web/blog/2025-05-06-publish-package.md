# Building and Publishing a Package to the Stel Registry

**By Mahesh**

Sharing your work with the world is easy with StelLang's package manager and registry. In this post, I'll walk you through building and publishing your own package.

## Step 1: Initialize Your Project

```sh
stel init my_library
cd my_library
```

## Step 2: Write Your Code

Create your library code in `.stel` files.

## Step 3: Build and Test

```sh
stel build
stel test
```

## Step 4: Publish to the Registry

```sh
stel publish
```

Your package will be available at [Stel Registry](https://stellang.maheshdhingra.xyz/registry) for others to discover and use!

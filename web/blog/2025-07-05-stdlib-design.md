# Designing the StelLang Standard Library

**By Mahesh**

The standard library is the heart of any language. Here’s how I designed and implemented StelLang’s stdlib.

## Goals
- **Simplicity**: Easy to use and understand
- **Power**: Covers common programming needs
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new modules

## Key Modules
- **math**: Mathematical operations
- **output**: Printing and formatting
- **rand**: Random number generation
- **ascii**: ASCII utilities
- **alloc**: Memory management

## Implementation
- Written in Rust for performance
- Exposed to StelLang via built-in modules

## Future Plans
- Add more modules for web, data, and networking
- Improve documentation and examples
